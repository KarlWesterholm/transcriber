It's show here. As you may have heard, Congress passed the Bill that the president signed into law that is designed to ban TikTok in the United States. That will take TikTok away from you and 170 million Americans who find community and connection on all platform. Make no mistake, this is a ban. A ban on TikTok and a ban on you and your voice. Politicians may see otherwise, but don't get confused. Many who sponsored the Bill admit a TikTok ban is the ultimate goal. It's obviously a disappointing moment, but it does not need to be a defining one. It's actually ironic because the freedom of expression on TikTok reflects the same American values that make the United States a beacon of freedom. TikTok gives everyday Americans a powerful way to be seen and heard. And that's why so many people have been TikTok part of their daily lives. Rest assured, we aren't going anywhere. We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts. The facts and the Constitution are on our side, and we expect to prevail again. A community is filled with people with found acceptance and compassion.

Our community is also filled with 7 million business owners who have built dear likelihoods on TikTok. While we make our case in court, you still be able to enjoy TikTok like you always. Have. In fact, if you have a story about how TikTok impacts your life, we love for you to share it, to showcase exactly what we're fighting for.
